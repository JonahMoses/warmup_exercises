The tricky thing here is that a leap year occurs:

```plain
on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
  except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
    except every year that is evenly divisible by 400.
```

For example, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is.
1900 is not a leap year, but 2000 is.
