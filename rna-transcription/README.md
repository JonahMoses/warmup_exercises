Both DNA and RNA strands are a sequence of nucleotides.

The four nucleotides found in DNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**), guanine (**G**) and thymidine (**T**).

The four nucleotides found in RNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**), guanine (**G**) and uracil (**U**).

Given a DNA strand, its transcribed RNA strand is formed by replacing all occurrences of thymidine with uracil.
